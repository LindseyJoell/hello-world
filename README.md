Learning how to use GitHub

My name is Lindsey Joell, and I am just a happy tech nerd expanding my knowledge in every direction possible.
Some of my skills include:
  -3D Animation
  -Motion Graphics
  -Video Editing
  -Graphic Design
  -VFX and Compositing
  -Website Design
And the list goes on. I'm here to learn as much as I can about code and it's implementation.
